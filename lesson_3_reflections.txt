When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When your project is collaborative, having a remote allows your other collaboraters to keep
their work together and synchronized. Also, if you want to share your project online, having
a remote repository allows others to see what you accomplished.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

Changes can cause conflicts. If you are developing a new feature, your priority is to finish
the feature, and then to resolve any conflicts. Manual pulling allows you to keep focus on
the development of features and then deciding when you want to include the latest version and 
integrate changes.
